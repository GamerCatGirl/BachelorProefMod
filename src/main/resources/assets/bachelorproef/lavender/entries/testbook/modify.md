Now the algorithm works only for the blocks: white-stained-glass, tinted-glass, gray-stained glass. Hint: edit the algorithm block-to-colorvalue, the blocks on the next page are written in the correct order.

**EX1: Make sure the algorithm works also for the blocks:**

;;;;;

*light-gray-tainted-glass, brown-stained-glass, red-stained-glass, orange-stained-glass, yellow-stained-glass, lime-stained-glass, green-stained-glass, cyan-stained-glass, light-blue-stained-glass, blue-stained-glass, purple-stained-glass,  magenta-stained-glass, pink-stained-glass.*

;;;;;

**EX2: Complete the function darker-than, the sort the blocks from dark to light.**

Hint: use the implementation of lighter-than.

;;;;;

**EX3: In our version of the insertion sort procedure, the outer loop runs from the end of the vector towards the start of the vector. The order of the inner loop is the opposite. Rewrite the procedure so that the order of the loops is reversed.**


**Q9: Which order will be the easiest to apply to single linked lists?**
