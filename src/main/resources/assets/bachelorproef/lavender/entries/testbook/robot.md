  "associated_items": [
    "minecraft:nether_quartz_ore"
  ]
}
```

Now you have fully studied insertion sort and selection sort. Now your robot can sort blocks, items, etc for you. You can use the command: 

/simple_sort vector_of_unsorted_blocks function_to_compare

!make sure the function and the vector are both defined in the file "lesson.rkt".
